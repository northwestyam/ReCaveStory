# ReCaveStory
## About the Project
ReCaveStory is a mod of the Pixel's Cave Story Game.  Based Christopher Hebert's tutorials, I plan to expand the game and learn more about 2D Game Architecture.  Also, I plan to deviate in game design as I become more familiar with the codebase.

## Game Architecture
1. This game will be built with C++.
2. I will be using gcc as my compiler. 
3. Parts of the Boost C++ library will be used.
4. I will adhere to the Google C++ Coding Guidelines.

## Game Art
You can use Pixel's sprites at www.cavestory.org!

## Dependencies
1. SDL1.3
2. SDL_image

## News & Updates
* 8/7/2016: Created a sprite cache, instead of opening the same sprite sheet over and over again. Sprite class can no longer create/delete surfaces.
* 7/28/2016: I separated input into it's own class and the player class will now be in charge of actually moving the sprite.
